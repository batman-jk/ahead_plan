  subtitle: "Open-ended skill intelligence — if you can name it, .ahead understands it",
  concept: "The skill taxonomy covers 1000+ sub-skills, but human knowledge doesn't fit in a list. Skill DNA is the system that handles everything outside the taxonomy. When a user types any skill — no matter how niche, emerging, or custom — the platform's LLM layer understands it, scores it, maps it to related known skills, and integrates it seamlessly into the Ahead Score. No skill is left unrecognized.",
  how_it_works: [
    { step: "01", title: "User Types a Custom Skill", desc: "On the skill selection screen, below the taxonomy, there is a free-text input: 'Know something not listed? Type it.' The user types anything — 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation', 'Blender 3D rigging', 'Solana smart contracts', 'Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback', 'Figma auto-layout', or even 'Prompt engineering for image models'." },
    { step: "02", title: "LLM Semantic Understanding", desc: "The typed skill is sent to the AI layer (Claude / GPT-4o). The model identifies: what domain this skill belongs to, what level of technical depth it implies, which known taxonomy skills it is most similar to, whether it is a sub-skill of an existing skill or a standalone skill, and an estimated rarity/demand score based on training knowledge." },
    { step: "03", title: "Auto Sub-Skill Generation", desc: "The LLM generates 5–12 contextually relevant sub-skills for the custom skill on the fly. These are not from a database — they are generated fresh, specific to what the user typed. The user then declares proficiency (Aware / Familiar / Proficient) on each generated sub-skill, exactly like the taxonomy flow." },
    { step: "04", title: "Skill DNA Fingerprint Created", desc: "The custom skill and its sub-skills are embedded using a vector embedding model (e.g. text-embedding-3-large). This embedding becomes part of the user's Skill DNA — a high-dimensional representation of their unique knowledge profile. It is stored in pgvector." },
    { step: "05", title: "Ahead Score Integration", desc: "The custom skill contributes to the Ahead Score exactly like any taxonomy skill — weighted by proficiency level and verification multiplier. The LLM also assigns a base_weight to the custom skill relative to demand and depth, which is used in scoring." },
    { step: "06", title: "Verification Still Applies", desc: "All five verification methods work for custom skills too. If you type 'RLHF' and pass a quiz (AI-generated on the fly for that skill), you get the 1.0× multiplier. Link a GitHub repo demonstrating it — 1.3×. The verification pipeline is skill-agnostic." },
    { step: "07", title: "Cross-User Aggregation", desc: "When enough users add the same custom skill (threshold: 50+ users), the platform automatically promotes it into the official taxonomy as a new verified skill.
